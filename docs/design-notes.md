# Design Notes


### Component Selection
- MCU = ATMEGA328PB-AU
  - worked with MCU before
  - cheap
  - I2C capabilities for sensor communication
  - UART abilities
  - AU = 32 pins = easier to solder by hand

- Sensor= BME280
  - measures temp, humidity, pressure
  - popular
  - I2C, therefore can communicate with ATmega328PB

- Regulator = MIC5504-3.3YM5-TR
  - 3.3V LDO
  - SOT23-5 (easier for soldering)
  - 300 mA
  - cheap
